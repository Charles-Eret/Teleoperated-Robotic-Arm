# Teleoperated-Robotic-Arm
This project enables the teleoperation of a robotic arm using mirror control with integrated haptic feedback. A human operator moves the leader arm, and the follower arm mimics these movements in real-time.
When the follower arm encounters an obstacle, the leader arm gripper experiences a resistance torque, providing the operator with tactile feedback. This intuitive system enhances control and interaction, making it ideal for applications in remote surgery, industrial automation, and assistive robotics. This project was guided by [Low-Cost Robot Arm by Tau Robotics](https://github.com/AlexanderKoch-Koch/low_cost_robot).
